(Running these programs requires the installation of the iMacros software on the Firefox Web Browser)

What are i-Macros:
i-Macros are programs that repeat repetitive tasks over and over again on the Firefox Browser. You can witness iMacros
in action because they act right through the browser itself. When you run a macro, you will see the browser running automatically
like a robot! You can stop the macro at any time. The best part about i-Macros are that they run extremely fast, faster than any human
can possibly operate a web browser. The most powerful part of i-Macros are that you can use Javascript to create iMacros, meaning that 
you can create dynamic macros with logical decisions and all the capabilities of Javascript. I have created a couple i-Macros for public use. 
Study my code and learn how to make your own macros!

***Make sure you store these macros under "C:\Users\userName\Documents\iMacros\Macros" if you want to be able to run them using Firefox, because otherwise 
the macros wont show up in the Firefox Browser***


My i-Macros:
"google_automated_search.js" ==> simply searches google for all the terms listed in the array. As soon as the first search loads, it loads the next search.
